Arrays are used to store certain values. Array is a collection of elements. Array store every value with an address/refernce called index. indexes starts from 0
Eg: let arr=[5,4,3,8]

Arrays are treated as 'object' datatype.

//Arrays have default methods
  i. length : length is used to return total number of elements in the array
  ii. indexOf: indexOf is used to find/return the indexOf first Occurrence of given element
  lastIndexOf: lastIndexOf is used to find/return the index of last Occurrence of given element
  iii. concat : concat is used to add two arrays.

*** Array is a non-primitve or reference data type. Arrays are mutable.
primitve data types compares values and non primitve data types compares address. primitve data types like strings are immutable(won't be changed) 
but non primitive datatypes like  arrays are mutable (will be changed)

   iv. push(): push is used to Append new elements to the end of an array, and returns the new length of the array.
    Eg: arr.push(5)
    5 will be added at end of array arr
   v. pop(): pop removes the last element from an array and returns it. If the array is empty, undefined is returned and the array is not modified if it is empty.
   vi. unshift(): unshift is used to append new elements to the start of the array and returns the new length of the array
   vii. shift(): shift is used to remove the first element of the array
   viii. splice(starting_index,deleteCount,insertingElements):
