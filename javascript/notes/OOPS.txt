Object oriented Programming in JS:
There are different kinds of programming approaches such as POP(procedure oriented programming),OOP,FP(functional programming) etc..,

JS supports both FP and OOP.
An object is a physical entity with properties and menthods
eg: object like fan have color,speed,no.of.wings and it can do rotation,
object like apple have color,taste,shape 

A collection of objects or A blueprint of objects is called class. it is a general idea of an object
Eg: Human is a class,prasad is object
Fruit is a class but specific fruit is object

classes are used to define structure/model for an object generally
Eg: class Teacher{
    name;age;salary;subject;
}
create an object: let obj-name= new classname();
new is a keyword to create object memory dynamically

let prasad= new Teacher();
classname() is called constructor. constructor is used to define/initiate the data. constructor is the first method called by object creation
class Teacher
{
    name; subject; salary;
    constructor(n,s,sa)
    {
        this.name = n;
        this.subject = s;
        this.salary = sa;
    }
}
let obj = new Teacher("Prasad","physics",52000);

'this' is a keyword to refer current calling object

classes are used for encasupating the data (wrapping up data and methods into one unit )
