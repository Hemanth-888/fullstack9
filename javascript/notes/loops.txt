Loops are used to iterate certain statements. iterate means repeat
Loops are divided as two types
i. Entry control Loops
ii. Exit control Loops
To work with loops, we need initialization, condition , updation
i. Entry control loops: Entry control loops checks the condition at the start/entry of the loop
Eg: while,for
ii. Exit Control loops: Exit control loops checks the condition at the exit of the loop
Eg: dowhile



i. while: while is an entry control loop used to iterate certain statements based on a condition
initialization;
while(condition){
    //code
    updation;
}

ii. dowhile: do while is an exit control loops used to iterate certain 
statements based on a condition
initialization;
do{
    //code
    updation;
}while(condition);


for loops: for loop is an entry control loop used to iterate certain statements
based on a condition. for loop contains all initialization,condition and updation in single line
for(initialization;condition;updation)
{
        //code
}
