Function: function is used to do a particular task. The code can be divided into multiple logical tasks called functions. The main advantages of functions are reusability and easy to debug and understand

  -- simple function 
  function function-name(){
   // function definition
  }
  function_name() // function call

Function can accept parameters/arguments which are passed in function call
   function function_name(a,b){
    //function definition
   }
   function_name(5,3)
   then a will be assigned 5 and b value will be 3,

In a case the number of values passed are less than the actual arguments function expects , then remaining values will be by default 'undefined'

REST and SPREAD operators:
   REST operator is used to combine the rest of the elements as a array. 
  Eg:  function function_name(a,...b){
  //function definition
 }
 function_name(5,4,3,2,1)
 Here a value is 5 and b value is [4,3,2,1]
 REST operator is denoted by three dots and it will be always the last parametr/argument
 
 SPREAD operator is used to spread/split the rest of element out of the array
 Eg: function function_name(){
      let arr=[2,5,6,7];
      let brr= ["john",...arr]
      console.log(brr)
 }
 function_name()


function expressions:
functions can be expressed as a variable so that we can name an anonymous  functions
eg: let var_name= function(){
  //definition
}

Difference between function and function expression is functions have a name and function expression explicitly gives name to anonymous functions


function expressions can also be expressed as arrow functions. Arrow functions are the modern way of representing functions.

let var_name= () => {
  //definition
}

callback functions: 
  callback functions are the functions which are written/passed as a parameter to another function.
  function fun1(){

  }
  function fun2(x){
    x()
  }
  fun2(fun1)

closure: closures are used to store user's response/input -output values for faster results
closure means inner function remembers outer function values
even after outer function execution ended

In real time closures are used for memorisation techniques
