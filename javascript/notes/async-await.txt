async await:
   it is a modern approach to resolve promise chaining. insead of using then,catch, we can use await keyword to make code looks more linear and simple.
   Eg: Instead of writing
   fetch(url)
    .then(callback)
    .catch(callback)

    we can write async
    await fetch(url)

    We can resolve errors by using error handling blocks
    errors handling is used to handle the errors using try,catch,finally,throw
    eg: let name= "prasad"
    try{
        if(name=="prasad){
            throw new Error("do not use this name")
        }
        else{
            console.log(name)
        }
    }
    catch(err){
        console.log(err)
    }
    irrespective of errors, finally block will runs always
