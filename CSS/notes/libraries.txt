Libray is a pre written code used for specific purposes.
 imagine i gave some css file to you as following:
   .x{
    background-color:blue;
   }
   .y{
    background-color:red
   }
now you have to write HTML,which shows h1 "hellow world" in bg color red
  <h1 class="y">Hello World</h1>

  Libraries are also works similarly.
